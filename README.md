# Image Based Forest Fire Detection System
Forest fires can pose a real threat to human lives, ecological systems, and both commercial and noncommercial infrastructure. 
Many countries are trying to get hold on issues like wildlife extinction as well as the pollution caused by these fires. 
This project aims to detect forest fire using image processing and computer vision approach.
# OBJECTIVE
To detect fire in the fire prone regions with the help of image processing and computer vision approach in C language. 
This system covers feature extraction based on color space and binary classification concept.
It aims towards easier implementation rather than the currently available solutions that come along with complex application at large open spaces, response delays, and other problems like high maintenance.
# Methadology
The overall proposed solution is described as follows:
- Take images of real forest fire as input images.
- Apply preprocessing for image enhancement purposes.
- Extract relevant image features, which help to recognize forest fire such as YCbCr, color features, statistical features etc.
- Comparing the experimented values of these features with some actual values.
- Apply bagging concept to effeciently and accurately conclude if the image represents forest fire or not
Once the fire is detected, the concerned authorities like the fire department of that area can be informed about the threat, and hence, it would be easier to take the required action
