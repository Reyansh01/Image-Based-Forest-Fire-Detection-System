# Image-Based Forest Fire Detection System
Forest fires can pose a real threat to human lives, ecological systems, and both commercial and noncommercial infrastructure. 
Many countries are trying to get hold on issues like wildlife extinction as well as the pollution caused by these fires. 
This project aims to detect forest fire using image processing and computer vision approach.
# Objective
To detect fire in the fire prone regions with the help of image processing and computer vision approach in C language. 
This system covers feature extraction based on color space and binary classification concept.
It aims towards easier implementation rather than the currently available solutions that come along with complex application at large open spaces, response delays, and other problems like high maintenance.
